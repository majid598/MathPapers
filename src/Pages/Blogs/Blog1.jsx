        Area of Circles and Sectors (with visual proof)
      </h1>
      <p className="lg:text-xl text-center mt-10">
        Have you ever wondered how to find the area of a circle? Knowing how to
        calculate the area of circles is an important skill with many practical
        uses in everyday life. For instance, it can help you figure out how much
        paint you need to cover a round table or the amount of fabric required
        to make a circular tablecloth. Understanding the area of circular
        playgrounds can help when planning activities. With so many circular
        objects around us, learning how to find the area of a circle is quite
        useful! This article will guide you on how to find the area of any
        circle easily.

          What is a circle?

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-4">
          It is a round flat shape that has no corners or edges. A circle is
          practically a single curved line. All the points in this curved line
          are equidistant from a point called the Centre.{" "}

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-4">
          A circle sector is like a slice of a circle. It's a part bounded by
          two radii (plural of radius) and an arc.

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-4">
          The area is the amount of space inside the circle. To find the area of
          a circle, we use a special formula.

          Let&apos;s see how we can derive this formula step by step:

            First, we can take a circle and divide it into 16 sectors

            <span className="underline">
              Now let&apos;s arrange the sectors in an approximate rectangular
              shape.
            </span>{" "}
            The length is approximately half the total circumference of the
            circle.

            If we divide the circle into smaller sectors the shape will closely
            resemble a rectangle where the

            of the circumference and its width is equivalent to the radius. The

          Note that the approximated rectangle was made by combining the sectors
          of the circle. Thus the area of the rectangle should be equivalent to

            To find the area of a sector, we need to know what fraction of the
            whole circle the sector is. For example, if the sector is
            one-quarter (1/4) of the whole circle the area of the sector is
            simply 1/4th of the area of the circle.

            The central angle of the sector (the angle between the radii that
            make up the sector) can be used to determine what fraction of the
