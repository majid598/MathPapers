        Solving Equations (Single variable)
      </h1>
      <p className="lg:text-xl text-center mt-10">
        Linear equations state the equality of two expressions involving a
        variable. The solution to an equation is the value of the variable that
        satisfies the given condition. We solve equations by isolating the
        variable (unknown) on one side of the equation to find its value.

          At the heart of linear equations lies the idea of balance. The equal
          signs represent that is equal to . Our task is to isolate the variable
          x while ensuring both sides remain equal.

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-5 md:text-start text-center">
          Think of the linear equation as a balanced seesaw. If we add or remove
          weight from one side, the seesaw would lose its balance and one side
          would go up. However, if we add or remove weights on both sides, it
          remains balanced. We can use this same principle to solve linear
          equations. Whatever operation we perform on one side, we must perform
          on the other to maintain balance.

          Simplify Both Sides
        </h1>
        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-4 md:text-start text-center">
          We can start by simplifying both sides of the equation. Combine like
          terms and perform any necessary operations to make the equation as
          straightforward as possible. Notice that we aren&apos;t removing or
          adding anything extra to either side. We are just simplifying the
          expressions on both sides. Therefore, the equation will remain
          balanced during this step.

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-4 md:text-start text-center">
          Now, we need to isolate the variable (x) on one side of the equation.
          To achieve this, we must perform the inverse of each operation
          involving the variable on both sides of the equation.

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-8 md:text-start text-center">
          In our example equation, we can get rid of +4 by subtracting 4 from
          that side of the equation.

        <p className="lg:text-xl lg:w-3/4 mt-8 md:text-start text-center">
          If we do that the left side of the equation would be 4 less than the
